Just a test to see how easy/hard it is to get Rackspace MaaS to work with openstacksdk.

requires:
python-openstacksdk
rackspace-sdk-plugin

example connection:
import user_preference # this isn't a package, so must be ran from the base dir where user_preference.py is.
from openstack import connection
pref = user_preference.UserPreference()
conn = connection.Connection(preference=pref, auth_plugin="rackspace", username="MyRackspaceAcct", api_key="0000000000000000000")
conn.monitoring_service.find_entity("myentity") # searching for a name doesn't work because the entity filter only allows id..
